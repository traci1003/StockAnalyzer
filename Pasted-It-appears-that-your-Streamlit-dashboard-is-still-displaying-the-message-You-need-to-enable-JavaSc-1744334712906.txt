It appears that your Streamlit dashboard is still displaying the message: "You need to enable JavaScript to run this app." This issue is commonly encountered when deploying Streamlit applications on Replit and is often related to deployment configurations rather than your code itself.îˆ†

### ðŸ”§ Deployment Troubleshooting Steps

To resolve this, consider the following steps:

1. **Verify `.replit` Configuration**:îˆƒEnsure your `.replit` file specifies the correct run command. It should look likeîˆ„îˆ†
   ```ini
   run = "streamlit run app.py"
   ```
îˆ†
   Replace `app.py` with the name of your main Python file if it's different.

2. **Check for Errors in Logs**:îˆƒUse Replit's "Logs" tab to identify any runtime errors that might prevent the app from loading properlyîˆ„îˆ†

3. **Ensure Proper Port Listening**:îˆƒStreamlit apps should listen on all interfaces. Modify your code to includeîˆ„îˆ†
   ```python
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       import os
       port = int(os.environ.get("PORT", 8501))
       streamlit.run(app, host='0.0.0.0', port=port)
   ```
îˆ†
   This ensures compatibility with Replit's hosting environment.

4. **Consider Alternative Hosting Platforms**:îˆƒIf issues persist, deploying your Streamlit app on platforms like [Streamlit Community Cloud](https://streamlit.io/cloud) or [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) might offer a more seamless experienceîˆ„îˆ†
